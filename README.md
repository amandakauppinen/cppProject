This is my submission for assignment #7 from the project list for the C++ Object
Oriented Programming course (Fall semester 2018)

The prompts written below:

##General guidelines
Global variables may not be used in any of the assignments.
Classes that are to be saved to a file must provide overloaded operators for writing to and reading from a
file. A class may provide a separate member function for interactive entry of values.
Write user friendly programs:
 When user is requested to enter values program must clearly state what type of values are
expected
 If user enters an invalid value an error message must displayed
Reports must print data in formatted columns where printed data is aligned by columns. For example when
printing numbers make the field width large enough to hold largest number that you are going to print.
Do not use “magic numbers” – define constants if you need to limit for example the range of valid values.
Give descriptive names to classes and member functions.
Remember that you should delegate all tasks to objects. So start by thinking what each class in your
program does and what is the relation between the classes.
Ask questions and discuss your design decisions with the instructor and other students. Sharing and
exchanging ideas is an essential part of the learning process.
Assignments 11 and 12 are more challenging than 1 – 10.
